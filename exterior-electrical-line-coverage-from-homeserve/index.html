Provides up to $2,000 a year to fix outside electrical items, such as a weatherhead. It then outlines the so called benefits of their service for only $59.88 per year (but it only covers 11 months because there is a 30 day waiting period after you buy the service before it is effective.) The letter states that if the equipment gets damaged, that it�s our financial responsibility to fix it and this would cover up to $3000 worth of annual repairs/multiple service calls after a 30 day waiting period.

<p>I did a bit of reading and some say it�s not really worth it because breaks are so rare, and homeserve itself is associated with negative reviews. The letter states that if the equipment gets damaged, that it�s our financial responsibility to fix it and this would cover up to $3000 worth of annual repairs/multiple service calls after a 30 day waiting period. These flyers also stated that imp is not affiliated with homeserve ect., blablabla yadayadayada. Many homeowners aren�t aware that the exterior electrical lines and components on their property are their responsibility. Help safeguard your finances against the costs of emergency repairs with a home service repair plan from homeserve. Home Repair Plans Homeserve USA Utility.</p>
