<p>This is standard coverage of 1 litre paint. If you are applying a dark colored paint over a lighter colored paint, two coats will be sufficient. When it has been at least a few years since the exterior of your house has been painted, you definitely will want to do 1 coat of paint to make it look nice &amp; clean. Of course, it depends on the original color that is being covered up and the new color you are using. It depends on the nature of the project, but generally, two coats is the answer (one isn’t enough)! Project Modern Farmhouse Exterior Paint — Jackie James.</p>
