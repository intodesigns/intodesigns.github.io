<p>So, what is the ideal weather for exterior painting? Painting outdoors can be a tricky task. However, latex paints are best for most exteriors (we recommend 100% acrylic). Paint early in the season to seal away rot from winter water damage. The weather is getting cooler and eventually temps will drop too low and we will have to pull our crews inside, but while temps are warm during the day and cool at night, we will continue to paint exteriors knowing that you will still be getting a superior paint job.

<p>For this reason, spring is an ideal time to paint the exterior of your home. A new paint project also requires dry weather, so if rain is in the forecast, it’s not the best time to paint outside. Basically the best season to paint the exterior of your house depends on your local conditions. During the fall, the high and lows are less than other seasons, so it�s an excellent time to get to work. Paint early in the season to seal away rot from winter water damage.

<p>Since most exterior paint requires an ambient temperature of about 50 degrees, painting contractors risk poor paint application if they paint during the spring. Early summer and early autumn usually offer up the best weather conditions, with minimal rain and minimal fluctuations in temperature from day to night. The weather is getting cooler and eventually temps will drop too low and we will have to pull our crews inside, but while temps are warm during the day and cool at night, we will continue to paint exteriors knowing that you will still be getting a superior paint job. In all honesty, the best time to paint your house is any time when the temperature is between 50 and 90 degrees, and the forecast is looking pretty clear, feel free to go ahead with painting plans. Here is what our experts at hirshfield’s suggest for the best time to take on an exterior paint job. This Is the Best Time to Buy and Sell a House House.</p>
