<p>When done incorrectly, paint removal can cause more damage to a brick wall than leaving the paint intact. Along with that, it will provide further protection by preventing brick from cracking, peeling, mold, etc. The exterior paints are better at handling humidity, temperature changes, and other weather factors, as they’re formulated to resist the elements. The quality of your brick also should determine your choice. If you paint exterior brick, make sure you do it right when brick is painted poorly, it looks terrible and is extremely difficult to fix.

<p>It should be noted that the answer to this question depends on the current brick colour. Of course, you should power wash any painted exterior, not just brick. Once your brick is painted, it will no longer suck up every little bit of dirt and debris. After you paint your brick house, you can’t go back to its original brick exterior. Along with that, it will provide further protection by preventing brick from cracking, peeling, mold, etc. Exterior Paint Brick exterior house, Painted brick house.</p>
