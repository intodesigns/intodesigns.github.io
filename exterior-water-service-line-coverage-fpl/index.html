<p>When a home’s exterior water service line breaks, most people don’t know who to call for a repair. You probably received a letter, not that long ago, on “official” fpl letterhead, encouraging you to sign up for “exterior water line coverage” or a “water heater repair and replacement plan” from homeserve for just $3.99 to $6.99 per month, which is conveniently added to your fpl bill. “the water service line buried underground on your property could fail without warning.” then comes a call to action: $4.99 a month for up to $7,000 in coverage. Under my policy, exterior electric components attached to the house are covered. Service Line Coverage Suzanne Brown Agency LLC.</p>
