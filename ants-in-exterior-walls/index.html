<p>Ants usually live outside in and around wood or wet/damp areas, and occasionally you will see a few come into your home looking for food, shelter, or water. Vines or trees near exterior walls also act as a bridge for the ants and help them to enter residential areas. They look for the easy ‘chew’, targeting damp or damaged wood. Fire ants build nesting mounds near structures like fences, outbuildings, and a home’s exterior walls. It may be from the wooden baseboards and trim or from the studs in the exterior wall itself.
