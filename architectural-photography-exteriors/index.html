<p>Exteriors of buildings from around the world. A gallery of black and white and color photography of architectural exteriors and facades from contemporary and modern buildings as well as landmark buildings. Because this building is north facing and had to be shot during the winter months, the decision was taken to shoot at dusk, this also allowed traffic in front of the building to be reduced to light trails. Architecture photography (also referred to as building photography or structure photography) generally means photography that focuses on buildings. From shots of historical buildings to humble abodes, architectural photography covers photos that primarily showcase the interior or exterior of manmade structures.
