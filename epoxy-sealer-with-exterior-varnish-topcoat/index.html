<p>Two pack acrylic gloss varnish design to provide uv protextion to fluorescent paint systems. I started with waterbased dye to even out wood, followed by thinned down (25%) seal coat of petit marine flagship varnish, scuff sand and synthetic steel wool. This product features excellent weather and water resistance and can be used in many different applications, including balconies, parking decks and any other areas where a highly abuse and wear resistant surface is desired. An epoxy sealer with an exterior varnish topcoat is the most durable outdoor finish and can last for many, many years. The epoxy presents a friendly surface and makes it easy for many finishes to flow out and adhere very well. Varnishes MAP YACHTING.</p>

<p>Seal the edges of your plywood or the end grain of your timber like nothing else can; Exterior applications require a uv protective topcoat such as system three marine spar varnish or system three pennant topside paint. Totalboat penetrating epoxy cures slightly slower in order to create a hard, waterproof surface that not only prevents rot, but provides a stable coating for varnish, primer, or paint to adhere to more tenaciously. Apply two or three coats of varnish following the manufacturer’s recommendations. Additionally, epoxy resin can leave a project with a slick, sheen appearance.
