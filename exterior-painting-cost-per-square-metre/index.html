<p>It’ll cost anywhere from $0.50 to $3.50 per square foot to hire a painter for the exterior of your home. Many tradespeople will provide an exterior painting cost per square metre, so having the dimensions of your house could help this process. Exterior painting prep work includes sanding, washing, caulking, and repairs: $15 to $45 per square metre for brick exteriors $12 to $60 per square metre for timber exteriors weatherboard may cost about the same as timber the spread is greater for timber exteriors because timber may need more prep work and can involve more detailed painting. Painting the same wall using the trade ‘average’ the maths are (on a 10 litre basis) 160 = $1.33 per metre for sealer 120 and 160 x 2 = $2.90 per metre for topcoats 110 totalling $4.23, the difference less than the retail cost of paint at $6.45 per square metre.
