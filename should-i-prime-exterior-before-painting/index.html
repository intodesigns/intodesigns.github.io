<p>On a repaint some painters will use a primer tinted to the color of the paint to save on materials. Hope you found the article helpful. As a general rule, use an alkyd primer and a latex topcoat when repainting. To help the new paint adhere to the surface well, handyguy brian advises to prime when painting over a glossy paint. The primer will make the new coat of paint bond tightly to the substrate, which will increase the performance characteristics and durability of the paint system.
