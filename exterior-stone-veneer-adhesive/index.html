<p>For thin brick form veneer units, spread adhesive in a continuous layer nominally 3/16 to ¼ in. There are tools and masonry supply products that you will need to install your stone or brick veneer. Apply sheathing over the studs. Masonry veneer creates long lasting stone brick looking surfaces as long as the right veneer type is used, the installation is done by a professional and high quality materials, including masonry veneer mortar or adhesive, water and air barriers as well as pointing mortar, are used. Installing veneer can be a messy project when using mortar. Shop AirStone Airstone Exterior Adhesive at.</p>
