Detecting if rain has ruined your painting is easily done as the streaking and unevenness that results is apparent. No, but you need to plan around it because you cannot paint while it is raining. When painting outdoors, you run the risk of your exterior surface becoming moist, either from rain and snow or from humidity in the air. If you�re unsure if moisture is present on your exterior, do a detailed check of the surface you�ll be painting—if it feels wet, even in the slightest, do not paint. Can You Paint a House in Rainy Weather?.</p>

<p>No, but you need to plan around it because you cannot paint while it is raining. Summers and rainy season is not a good time for an exterior paint job and this is a no brainer! When painting outdoors, you run the risk of your exterior surface becoming moist, either from rain and snow or from humidity in the air. Exterior painting is a trickier proposition. Holding off until summer temperatures have truly arrived in late june, july, august, or early september produces the best results. Why winter is the best time to paint your exterior walls.</p>
