<p>If the weather is too hot, paint could dry too quickly and leave you with brush marks or streaks in the paint. A new paint project also requires dry weather, so if rain is in the forecast, it’s not the best time to paint outside.

Let’s make this easy, then: Early summer and early autumn usually offer up the best weather conditions, with minimal rain and minimal fluctuations in temperature from day to night. Is summer the best time to schedule exterior painting.</p>
