<p>Here’s a good example, no one and i mean no one, is asking me for brown exteriors right now because that trendy neutral went out of favour around 2009. Listed buildings and proposals for demolition will be assessed against the criteria set out in the scottish repair. What i mean is, if you wanted the outside walls of your listed cottage painting, you do not need to apply, in most cases, for consent, as long as the colour of paint is exactly the same and has been previously applied to the house. Planning rules known as permitted development rights allow defined categories of development to take place without the need for planning permission. By aligning your home’s exterior paint colors with the true identity of the home, you get colors that are appropriate for the home’s style that also honor and bring out all of the best aspects of the home. Another beautiful modern farmhouse 🏡 in highly desired.</p>
