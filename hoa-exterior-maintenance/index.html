<p>“we had some major hail storms about a year ago, and there was major roof damage across the city. A lot just say, �the association shall maintain exterior surfaces.� that unhelpful wording has led to some push and pull between hoas and owners. If you find areas of your hoa’s governing documents are unclear in assigning responsibility for certain building components, you are not alone. In a lot of townhomes, the hoa is responsible for exterior maintenance. The maintenance of the home exterior, such as siding, roof and gutters, could be covered by an hoa, especially in a townhome community where there are shared walls.

<p>The hoa’s duty to maintain the common areas includes an obligation to regularly inspect those common areas, and an obligation to maintain sufficient financial reserves to honor those duties. All defined areas of the property require maintenance and upkeep which is why we provide hoa landscaping maintenance and hoa exterior maintenance. Any exterior color change must be approved in advance in accordance with section s(b). In most cases, the hoa is responsible for all maintenance on the exterior of the buildings and the homeowners are responsible for everything on the interior of their unit. Inspect the property�s attic vents &amp; screens to ensure they are in good working order. HOA and Property Management Painting Vegas Painters.</p>
